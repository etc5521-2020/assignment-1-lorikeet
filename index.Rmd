# Introduction and motivation

[FILL] Give the bigger picture of the data, and inspire the reader to learn more about the problem by reading your analysis. 

# Data description

The data comprises of vaccination rates for 46,412 schools in 32 U.S states and was retrieved from The Wall Street Journal. The variables include; the school academic year, the school's state, city, county, district, name, type, enrollment, MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination rate, overall vaccination rate, latitude, longitude and the percentage of students exempted from vaccinations due to personal, religious or medical reasons. 

The data was collected in the 2017-18 school year for 11 states and 2018-19 school year for the remaining 21 states. The state health departments provided the vaccination data and the National Center for Education Statistic's provided the school location, which was matched against the school name. In the case that there was no match, the school's location was found with Google Maps API. 

The individual state dataset was scraped from WSJ github repository and combined with the existing measles dataset with *left_join* to extract the longitude and latitude variables from it. Various functions from the *rvest* package were used to scrape the data including *read_html* and *html_table*.

**Primary Question**: Does Measles vaccination rate improve with better socio-economic conditions?

**Secondary Questions**:

- 1. Which states have the highest and lowest vaccination rates?
- 2. What is the average income in the states with the highest and lowest vaccination rate?
- 3. Is the vaccination rate higher in private schools?
- 4. How does the MMR vaccination rate compare to the school's overall vaccination rate?


# Analysis and findings

[FILL] Should include at least one plot or numerical summary for each of your questions, that helps the reader arrive at an answer. You should also write paragraphs describing the methods, summaries and findings.
